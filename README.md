This project implements a NoSQL distributed database system for an e-commerce marketplace using **MongoDB** and **Mongoose (Node.js)**. The goal is to manage data for products, users, orders, and reviews in a scalable, modular architecture.


##  Project Structure

```
DBD381-Ecommerce/
├── data/               # Static data arrays (10 sample records each)
├── models/             # Mongoose schemas
├── node_modules/       # All node modules used
├── populate/           # Insert functions for each collection
├── .env                # Environment variables (MongoDB URI, DB name)
├── .gitattributes      # Generated by GitHub
├── .gitignore          # Made to not include .env to commit
├── index.js            # Main script: connects, inserts, disconnects
├── package.json        # Generated via npm init -y command in bash
├── README.md           # This file containing project information
```


## Requirements

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- MongoDB Atlas account
- Internet connection


##  Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone or Extract the Project

If downloaded as a `.zip`, extract and open the `DBD381-Ecommerce` folder.


### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```


### 3. Run the Project

```bash
npm start
```

This will:
- Connect to MongoDB
- Insert the sample data (if it doesn't already exist)
- Disconnect automatically


## Collections Inserted

- `users`
- `products`
- `orders`
- `reviews`

Each contains **10 well-structured sample documents**.


## Testing & Verification

You can verify the inserted data using **MongoDB Compass**:
1. Connect with the same MongoDB URI.
2. Open the `ecommerce` database.
3. View your 4 collections and documents.


## Online Use

This code is designed to be able to use online at distrubted locations so that various users can access the data. This is achieved by the URI for the database being set to a remote MongoDB(Atlas) server.



## Notes

- Each insert function checks for existing IDs before inserting.
- The project is modular and cleanly structured for scaling.
